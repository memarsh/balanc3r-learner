# balanc3r-learner
A Lego robot that uses reinforcement learning to balance itself

Trouble-shooting tips:
- disconnect sensors before turning on robot
- when the robot is calibrating which way is 'up' (after the touch sensor is pressed and before the starting beep sounds), try to make sure the robot isn't leaning forward or backward, even slightly
